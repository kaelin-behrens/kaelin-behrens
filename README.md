## Welcome! I'm Kaelin, I'd like to make the world a better place through play.

I'm a recent graduate of Dev Academy Aotearoa where I have become a fullstack React webdev. Its there I discovered that I have a talent for organising groups, collaborating with others, and generating new ideas.

I'm now studying full time to finish a degree in Criminology while continuing to work on projects, old and new. I'm currently teaching myself to use Godot and working on the concepts for a game of my own. My goal is to build something that can be both fun and educational, and to have it published by BIGMODE, a company led by a creator I respect with a vision for the gaming industry that can only make it better for everyone.

Feel free to browse my work!
